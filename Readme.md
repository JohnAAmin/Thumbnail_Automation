This code is used to create Thumbnails for Peak Tournaments.

1. The script reads yaml to determine players, charaters, tournament, and round.

2. Then script opens a Photoshop file and produces pictures with the player,
    character, tournament, and round.

3. Images are exported and used in Youtube Thumbnails.
